# jsdoc-githubify [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/jsdoc-githubify.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thlorenz/jsdoc-githubify)

A transform that adapts html files generated with jsdoc to be rendered in a github wiki or readme.

As part of that it converts all source code indicators to point to the relevant file inside your github repository.

## Installation

    npm install jsdoc-githubify

## How do I use this?

[wicked](https://github.com/thlorenz/wicked) is using this transform to adapt html files generated by
[jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) in order to generate API wiki pages for your project.

## API

### gitifyTransform(file)

The resulting html has the following transformations:
  - all code sample links are redirected point to gihub repo blob

#### Note:

The github blob url is derived from the remote of the github repository in the current directory
and the currently checked out branch is used. You can override these with the following environment vars:

- `JSDOC_GITHUBIFY_REMOTE`
- `JSDOC_GITHUBIFY_BRANCH`
